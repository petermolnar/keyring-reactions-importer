A social reactions ( comments, like, favs, etc. ) importer.

== Description ==

A [backfeed](http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed) to have all the reaction from all the social networks you have a copy of your post at!

Using the `syndication_urls` post meta field populated by either the [Syndication Links](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/) plugin or by hand the Keyring Reactions Importer will pull all the comments, favs, likes, votes, etc. from any supported networks to comments in WordPress.

Currently supported networks:

* [500px](http://500px.com/) - comments, favs, likes
* [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) - comments, favs

The plugin uses the brilliant  [Keyring](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring/) for handling networks and us based on [Keyring Social Importers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyring-social-importers/); both from [Beau Lebens](http://dentedreality.com.au/).
